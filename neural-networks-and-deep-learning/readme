In this course, I learnt the foundations of deep learning. I Understood the major technology trends driving Deep Learning - Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks - Understood the key parameters in a neural network's architecture. I also learnt how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description.
